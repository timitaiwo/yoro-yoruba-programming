# yọrọ-yoruba-programming

Yọrọ is an attempt at creating a static compiled programming language using Yoruba language constructs.

It is based off work done using [YorLang](https://anoniscoding.github.io/yorlang/docs/doc.html)


```
  jẹki orukọ = "Daramọla"

  sọpe("Orukọ mi ni ", orukọ)
```

The above scipt should print "Orukọ mi ni Daramọla" when compiled and run
